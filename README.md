## Introduction

Neural networks are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. Their structure is inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way biological neurons signal to one another.

## Overview of Neural Networks

### What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a series of algorithms that attempt to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. Neural networks can adapt to changing input, so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.

### Types of Neural Networks

- **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**: The simplest type of artificial neural network. In this network, the information moves in only one direction—forward—from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any), and to the output nodes.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Primarily used for image processing, these networks are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Designed for sequential data, these networks have connections that form directed cycles. They use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A type of RNN that is capable of learning long-term dependencies. LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem.

### Applications of Neural Networks

Neural networks are widely used in various applications such as:

- Image and speech recognition
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial predictions
- Autonomous vehicles
- Natural language processing

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `models/`: Contains the implementation of different neural network models.
- `datasets/`: Contains scripts and utilities for handling various datasets.
- `experiments/`: Includes experiment scripts and results.
- `results/`: Directory to store the results of experiments, including logs and visualizations.
- `docs/`: Documentation and resources related to the project.

## Usage

### Training a Model

To train a neural network model, configure the appropriate scripts in the `experiments/` directory and run them.

### Evaluating a Model

To evaluate a trained model, use the provided evaluation scripts in the `experiments/` directory.

## Models

This project includes implementations of the following models:

- **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**
